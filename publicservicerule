    "content": "This Edition of the Public Service Rule is a review of the 2007 Edition, which is principally intended to update the rules, regulations and procedures in the Public Service and bring them in line with the current trend in governance. The revision of this strategic document of the Public Service on a regular basis is necessary in order to make the service conform with changing times and circumstances. The objective, therefore, is to effectively reposition the service for higher level of efficiency, effectiveness and enhanced service delivery.\n\nThe main thrust of the 2008 Edition of the Public Service Rules is to ensure that the fundamental ethical issues in the Public Service are strictly adhered to. It is, therefore, aimed at entrenching the issues of transparency, accountability, justice, equity, due process, and the rule of law. All these are very paramount to the conduct of Government business, which all Public Servants must imbibe.\n\nAs the machinery through which Government articulates and implements its policies and programmes, the Public Service needs to be provided with the enabling environment to play this pivotal role effectively; although the removal of obsolete rules and regulations as well as the entrenchment of the core values and professional standards of the Service. The long term goals of this review, therefore, is to achieve our national development agenda and collective goal of becoming one of the 20 leading industrialized nations of the world by 2020 through a focused and vibrant Public Service.\n\nI, therefore, urge all Public Servants to acquaint themselves with these Rules and Regulations as well as other extant laws for effective Public Service administration and to ensure their application in a manner that would enhance the smooth functioning of the Public Service."
