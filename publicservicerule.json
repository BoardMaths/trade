(i) The officer shall be notified in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to discipline him/her. The query should be precise and to the point. It must relate the circumstances of the offence, the rule and regulation which the officer has broken and the likely penalty. In serious cases which are likely to result in dismissal, the officer should be given access to any such document(s) or report(s) used against him/her and he/she should be asked to state in his/her defence that he/she has been given access to documents. The officer shall be called upon to state in writing, within the period specified in the query any grounds upon which he/she relies to exculpate himself/herself; (ii) The query, or preliminary letter, shall be in the format shown in Appendix II; (iii) If the officer submits his/her representations and the Federal Civil Service Commission is not satisfied that he/she has exculpated himself/herself, and considers that the officer should be dismissed, it shall take such action accordingly. Should the officer however fail to furnish any representations within the time fixed, the Commission may take such action against the officer as it deems appropriate; (iv) If upon considering the representations of the officer the Commission is of the opinion that the officer does not deserve to be dismissed from the Service but deserves some other punishment, it shall impose on the officer such punishment as it considers appropriate; (v) Where necessary, the Commission may set up a board of inquiry which shall consist of not less than three persons one of whom shall be appointed chairman by the Commission. The members of the board shall be selected with due regard to the status of the officer involved in the disciplinary case and to the nature of the complaint which is the subject of inquiry. The head of the officer's department shall not be a member of the board; (vi) The officer shall be informed that, on a specific day, the question of his/her dismissal shall be brought before the board and he/she shall be required to appear before it to defend himself/herself and shall be entitled to call witnesses. His/her failure to appear shall not invalidate the proceedings of the board; (vii) Where witnesses are called by the board to give evidence before it, the officer shall be entitled to put questions to the witnesses and no documentary evidence shall be used against the officer unless he/she has previously been supplied with a copy thereof or given access thereto; (viii) If during the course of the inquiry further grounds for dismissal are disclosed, and the Federal Civil Service Commission thinks it fit to proceed against the officer upon such grounds, the officer shall, by the direction of the Commission, be furnished with a written statement thereof and the same steps shall be taken as prescribed above in respect of the original grounds; (ix) The board having inquired into the matter shall make a report to the Commission. If the Commission considers that the report should be amplified in any respect or that further inquiry is desirable, it may refer any matter back to the board for further inquiry or report. The Commission shall not itself hear witnesses; (x) If upon considering the report of the board together with the evidence and all material documents relating to the case, the Commission is of the opinion that the officer should be dismissed, such action shall immediately be taken; (xi) If the Commission does not approve the officer's dismissal and does not consider that any penalty should be imposed, the officer shall be reinstated forthwith and be entitled to the full amount of salary denied him/her if he/she was interdicted or suspended; (xii) If upon considering the report of the board the Commission is of the opinion that the officer does not deserve to be dismissed but that the proceedings disclosed grounds for requiring him/her to retire, the Commission shall, without further proceedings, direct accordingly; and (xiii) All disciplinary procedures must commence and be completed within a period of 60 days except where it involves criminal cases."

The period must be fixed at the time the increment is deferred and must not be less than three months nor more than six months. If less than six months in the first instance, it may, if necessary, be increased to six months by additional specific deferment.

However, the recipient retains his/her original incremental date for subsequent increments. If a deferred increment is not granted at or before the expiration of six months from the date it was originally due it must be withheld.\n\nExample: if an officer who is due to proceed from N147,968 to N152,950 per annum on 1-1-2005 had his increment deferred for three months his salary shall remain at N147,968 until 31-3-2005 when his/her Permanent Secretary/Head of Extra-Ministerial Office must decide whether or not to grant the deferred increment. If he/she grants it, the officer draws monthly emolument at N152,950 for the period 1-4-2005 to 31-12-2005(i.e. the remaining nine months) and retains his/her original incremental date of 1st January for consideration of his next increment to N157,932."
